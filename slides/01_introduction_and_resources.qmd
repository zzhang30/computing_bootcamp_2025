## Welcome

Welcome to the Department of Statistical Science (DSS).

You can find all slides and source code at  
[https://github.com/DukeStatSci/computing_bootcamp_2024](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/computing_bootcamp_2024).

By the end of today's workshop you will

- understand the computing resources available to you within 
  the DSS and Duke University as well as how to get help when needed

- work with containerized versions of R and Python and understand the importance of literate programming and reproducible research

- collaborate and manage your work via version control with git/GitHub

- setup and run jobs on Duke Compute Cluster (DCC)

# Thanks 

Special thank you to Prof. Colin Rundel for this slide deck.

# Duke Computing Resources


## Duke NetID

Your Duke NetID is the electronic key to making many Duke resources work.  

All of the following can be accomplished at <https://idms-web-selfservice.oit.duke.edu/>:

  - Changing your password
  
  - Changing your challenge questions
  
  - Setup multi-factor authentication (Duo recommended)
  
  - Change email alias(es)
  
  - ssh keys + default shell


## Duke email

With your NetID and password, you can access your email on the web at
[mail.duke.edu](http://mail.duke.edu)

- Your Duke email is not permanent; your account expires once you leave Duke.

- Mail forwarding is possible but not recommended



## Duke WiFi

Duke network connections:

- Dukeblue:

    - 24-hour access to secure (encrypted) wireless throughout Duke's 
      residence halls, academic and administrative buildings

- DukeOpen:

    - unencrypted wireless access for devices such as gaming systems, IOT, or 
      other devices

- Eduroam (education roaming):

    - secure (encrypted) wireless access using your Duke NetID and password
    
    - To use eduroam at a participating institution, configure 
      your machine ahead of time while at Duke - 
      <https://oit.duke.edu/service/eduroam/>.


## Multi-factor authentication

To access some resources on campus (e.g. mail, vpn, etc.) you will need to periodically undergo MFA when you login.

This is relatively easy to setup using Duo or Duke Unlock - see instructions at <https://idms-mfa.oit.duke.edu/mfa/home>


## Duke VPN

- Duke's virtual private network (VPN) allows you to create a secure connection 
  from your computer to Duke over a public network while working remotely. This
  will be necessary for you to use, if you want to access certain Duke and DSS
  resources off campus.

- Instructions to get started with the VPN are available on the next slide.
  For more information on Duke's VPN visit
  <https://oit.duke.edu/what-we-do/services/vpn>.


## Duke VPN set-up

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='50%'}
1. Download and install the free Cisco AnyConnect VPN 
   [software](https://software.duke.edu)

2. Launch Cisco AnyConnect on your machine

3. Enter `vpn.duke.edu` in the box and click `Connect`.<br/>

## Software Site Licenses

- Duke offers software for download to students, faculty, and staff through 
  [software.duke.edu](https://software.duke.edu/)

- Duke negotiates with vendors to make software available to the Duke community 
  for discounted rates or, in many cases, for free. If you have any questions, 
  comments or suggestions, please e-mail the site-license office at 
  [site@duke.edu](mailto:site@duke.edu).

- Some free software relevant to you as students: 

  :::: {.columns}
  ::: {.column width='50%'}
    - Microsoft Office
    - MATLAB & Simulink
    - SAS
  :::
  
  ::: {.column width='50%'}
    - Mathematica
    - Tableau
    - Adobe Creative Cloud

## Virtual computing

Duke OIT offers virtual software containers and semester-long virtual machines.

- [Virtual Software Containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/) – 
  Students and instructors can reserve personal computer environments running 
  applications such as RStudio, Eclipse, Jupyter Notebooks, Matlab, and others for a semester. These are run through your
  web browser; no software download is required. 
  
  Two containers likely to be most useful are:
    
    - `RStudio` - statistics application with Rmarkdown and knitr support
    - `Jupyter` - interactive data science and scientific computing notebooks

##

- [Virtual Machine (VM)](https://vcm.duke.edu/) – Your Duke VM is like having a 
  second computer that lives at Duke. You can log into and use your VM 
  from your own machine. It allows you to access specialized software without 
  installing it on your own computer, host your own server for development 
  projects and coursework, or customize your own environment to use for the 
  semester.
  
    - Run Windows or Linux VMs
    - Computing resources are light: 2 processors and 2GB of memory
    - By default each VM will power down at 6:00 am every morning
      - Can be avoided if you have a reasonable use case


## Duke Compute Cluster

The Duke Compute Cluster (DCC) consists of machines that the University has 
provided for community use and that researchers have purchased to conduct their 
research. You will need to be given access before use.

- Runs Linux (CentOS 8) and uses the SLURM job management system

- Offers over 1300 nodes with more than 30,000 cores, 750 GPUs, 200 TBs of RAM and 7 PB file system.

- Most nodes are purchased by labs and departments.

- [OnDemand](https://dcc-ondemand-01.oit.duke.edu/) for interactive use

- Requires sponsorship by a faculty member to use (you all have access currently)

Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT) offers a host of resources, including  [workshops](https://oit-rc.pages.oit.duke.edu/rcsupportdocs/help/training/) to help new users. 


## Getting help with Duke resources

Duke Office of Information Technology (OIT) manages Duke’s technology 
infrastructure and application support.

# DSS Computing Resources


## RStudio Workbench

The DSS has an Posit / RStudio Workbench (formerly Pro) license that will allow you to connect to an instance of RStudio (or Jupyter Lab or VS Code) in your browser while making use of the computing power of a remote multiprocessor server.

To access RStudio Pro:

1. If off campus, use the VPN to create a secure connection from your computer 
   to Duke. If you are on campus, be sure you are connected to the DukeBlue
   network.

2. Navigate to: <https://rstudio.stat.duke.edu>

3. Log-in with your NetID and password.


## Other resources

- Local file system on DSS servers

  - Connect via SSH 
  ```
  ssh netid@ssh.stat.duke.edu
  ```
