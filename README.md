*A video recording of a portion of the bootcamp today, recorded and added by popular request. The recording starts a few minutes after the break and roughly covers: (1) recap of setting up git, committing and pushing from terminal (2) RStudio and Python container accession (3) Useful unix commands and file system recap and (4) interacting with DCC.
